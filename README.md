# Outlook-Google-Calendar-Sync
An Outlook addin to sync google calendars with outlook calendars.

The first release of the add-in is available for use. It comes with the ability to sync multiple calendars either by syncing the full calendar or a date range. You can also schedule calendar syncs as you see fit. Any calendar you add during the inital setup will be scheduled to automatically update. As changes are made to Outlook or Google the calendar will automatically sync the established calendar pairs. If you would like to download it just click the Release tab at the top of the page and you can either download by Source or a Setup file.

If you have any issues running the plugin please create an issue for me to troubleshoot and fix. Make sure you provide details of how to
recreate the issue. If you have the call stack paste a copy of it in the issue as well.
